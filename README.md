# sveltekit-with-cf-handlers

This is a demo project for [sveltejs/kit#14029](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/14029), showcasing integration with [Cloudflare Worker handlers â€” Scheduled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/scheduled/).

It demonstrates how to extend a SvelteKit app with custom Cloudflare Worker handlers using the new `workerScriptPath` option.

# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
